//! FastCGI forwarder: connect, split the socket, and write the request on one
//! half while reading the response on the other.
//!
//! The response head goes out as soon as the CGI header block completes;
//! STDOUT records after it are relayed to the client one at a time, so a
//! streamed PHP response (SSE, Livewire `wire:stream`) reaches the browser as
//! PHP flushes it. Two consequences worth knowing:
//!
//! * A failure *after* the head is on the wire cannot change the status, so it
//!   aborts the connection instead. Failures before it still return a
//!   `ProxyError` and get the usual clean 5xx.
//! * A response hyper cannot give a body to (HEAD, 1xx, 204, 304) is drained
//!   here rather than streamed. Hyper drops such a body the instant the head is
//!   encoded, which would otherwise read as a client disconnect and kill the
//!   PHP script mid-run.
//! * The request write outliving the response read is deliberate: PHP may
//!   answer before it has read STDIN, and abandoning a part-read request body
//!   makes hyper close the client's read side under an upload still in flight.
